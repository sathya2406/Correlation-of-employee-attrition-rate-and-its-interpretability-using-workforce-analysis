# Correlation-of-employee-attrition-rate-and-its-interpretability-using-workforce-analysis
∗ Utilized IBM HR data to investigate the correlation between employee attrition rate and various workforce factors and
created a web user interface using flask, which can be a helpful tool for stakeholders to interact with and evaluate
employees and the probability of attrition.
∗ Built and compared multiple machine learning models to predict employee attrition, ultimately selecting an
XGBRFClassifier with Grid Search CV for hyper parameter tuning and k-fold cross-validation ensemble model based on
AUC-ROC and accuracy, achieving an accuracy of 87 percent.
